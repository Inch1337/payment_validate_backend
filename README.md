# Payment System (Learning Project)

This is my first large project. The goal is to build a small payment system while learning how to create an IT product and improve my Go skills.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Run the application:

   ```bash
   go run cmd/app/main.go
   ```

## Project Goals

### Completed

* ✅ Use interfaces
* ✅ Add the `regexp` package
* ✅ Implement a factory pattern
* ✅ Add the `time` package
* ✅ Create internal packages
* ✅ Write documentation in English

### Planned
* ❌ Add generics to Validator()
* ❌ Don't use reflect in fabric
* ✅ Move validation logic (email, card number, etc.) into a separate package
* ❌ Add unit tests
* ❌ Rebuild packages for more convenient imports (e.g. `import "github.com/inch1337/..."`)
* ❌ Add PostgreSQL or MySQL
* ❌ Rebuild the project as an API

## Notes

This project is educational and under active development. The architecture and features may change as I learn and improve the codebase.
